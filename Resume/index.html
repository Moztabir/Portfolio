                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Moztabir Islam</strong>, a passionate and hardworking individual currently on a journey to becoming a skilled <strong>web and game developer</strong>. My curiosity and drive to constantly learn new skills keep me on my toes, pushing me to improve both in programming and game design.</p>
                <p>From a young age, I found myself fascinated by the world of <strong>games</strong>. It was through playing them that I discovered my passion for development and decided to turn that interest into a career. Now, I’m diving deep into the worlds of <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, and <strong>Lua</strong>, constantly learning and growing.</p>
                <p>When I’m not coding or working on a game, you’ll find me capturing the beauty of the world through <strong>landscape photography</strong>, playing <strong>soccer</strong>, or exploring the creative possibilities with <strong>3D printing</strong>.</p>

                    This project focuses on visualizing the structural and linguistic analysis of essays, particularly analyzing word count and how the essay is structured. By using 3D data visualization, this tool presents essay data in a dynamic and interactive manner.

The visualization uses a grid of cubes where each cube represents a word or section of an essay. The colors of the cubes (red, blue, yellow) signify different themes or categories within the essay, such as chip, city, and night. The size of the cubes may correspond to the word count or frequency of specific terms used in the essay, allowing for an immediate visual understanding of the essay's content.

                <p>This 2D platformer was built in Unity and challenges players to shoot at targets, collect coins, and dodge bombs falling from above. The knight character must navigate various platforms and hazards, requiring quick reflexes and strategic movement. Through level design and game mechanics, the project demonstrates skills in C# scripting, sprite animation, and collision detection. This game showcases a fun yet challenging experience that highlights both creativity and technical proficiency in Unity development.

                <p>In this branching narrative game built with Twine, you play as a daring operative on a mission to recover a critical chip from the heavily guarded Arkansa Tower. With corporate security hot on your heels, each choice you make determines your path—will you fight your way out, or find a stealthy escape? The game combines atmospheric visuals and immersive storytelling, showcasing skills in interactive narrative design, branching storylines, and player-driven decision-making.</p>

                <h3>Project 4</h3>
                <p>In this 3D shooting game, I built a full gameplay experience using Unity, where players engage in fast-paced combat. While developing this project, I focused on designing and integrating basic game components such as a health bar, ammo count, and score counter. Additionally, I enhanced the gameplay experience by working on the user interface (UI), sound effects (SFX), and visual effects (VFX). This project not only improved my skills in component design and system integration but also provided valuable hands-on experience in managing game feedback and aesthetics in a real-time environment.</p>

                <p>Etch Fusion is a website that unites creative artistry with modern laser engraving technology to provide personalized, high-quality solutions. Built to showcase the brand’s dedication to craftsmanship, the site features a polished user interface, intuitive navigation, and refined visuals. Throughout the development process, I focused on ensuring a seamless user experience and professional design aesthetic. From concept to launch, this project demonstrates proficiency in front-end development, brand-oriented design, and the importance of clear, engaging content.</p>
